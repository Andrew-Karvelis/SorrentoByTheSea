    <h2> Testimonials </h2>
    <p>
      "So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"
    </p>
    <p>  
      "Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt.  Thank you."

    <p>

    <h2> How to get to Sorrento by the Sea </h2>
    <p>
      It is easy to find. From Melbourne, take the Monash Freeway, connect onto the Eastlink heading for Portsea, then onto the Peninsula link to Sorrento.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option is the scenic drive around the beach. Although longer, it allows you to experience the coastline from Port Melbourne to Sorrento. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to come across on the Queenscliff/Sorrento Ferry, it is only a 2 minute drive from the Ferry Depot. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a foot passenger we are happy to meet you at the Sorrento ferry at. Just phone us on 0435 123 456 as you arrive.
